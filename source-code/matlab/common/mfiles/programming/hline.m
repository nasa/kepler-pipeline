function hhh=hline(y,in1,in2)
% function h=hline(y, linetype, label)
% 
% Draws a horizontal line on the current axes at the location specified by 'y'.  Optional arguments are
% 'linetype' (default is 'r:') and 'label', which applies a text label to the graph near the line.  The
% label appears in the same color as the line.
%
% The line is held on the current axes, and after plotting the line, the function returns the axes to
% its prior hold state.
%
% The HandleVisibility property of the line object is set to "off", so not only does it not appear on
% legends, but it is not findable by using findobj.  Specifying an output argument causes the function to
% return a handle to the line, so it can be manipulated or deleted.  Also, the HandleVisibility can be 
% overridden by setting the root's ShowHiddenHandles property to on.
%
% h = hline(42,'g','The Answer')
%
% returns a handle to a green horizontal line on the current axes at y=42, and creates a text object on
% the current axes, close to the line, which reads "The Answer".
%
% hline also supports vector inputs to draw multiple lines at once.  For example,
%
% hline([4 8 12],{'g','r','b'},{'l1','lab2','LABELC'})
%
% draws three lines with the appropriate labels and colors.
